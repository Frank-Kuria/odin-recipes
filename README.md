# odin-recipes
The project is all about various recipes in my country Kenya and specifically the Kikuyu Community.

The skills i will demonstrate in this project are how to create a HTML file from the command line, how to fill out the HTML Boilerplate, how to link different pages, how to add an image in HTML and how to create an ordered and unordered list.
